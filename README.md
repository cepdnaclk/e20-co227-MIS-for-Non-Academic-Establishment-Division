# MIS for Non-Academic Establishment Division
___

The Non-Academic Establishment Division is responsible for various tasks related to the
management and administration of non-academic staff at the University of Peradeniya. These
tasks include maintaining staff records, handling recruitment, transfers, promotions, leaves,
retirements, and other employee-related processes. The current system is manual and
paper-based, leading to inefficiencies and difficulties in data management and reporting. The
proposed MIS aims to streamline these processes, improve data accuracy, and enhance overall
operational efficiency.
